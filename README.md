# Simpsons Character Analysis

This project is a data analysis exercise using Python that consumes The Simpsons API to analyze character names.

It is my first project working with an external API, focused on practicing data processing and visualization using real data.

---

# Project Overview

The program retrieves a list of characters from The Simpsons API, processes the data using pandas, and visualizes statistics related to character name lengths using matplotlib.
The main objective is to analyze all available characters and determine which ones have the longest names.

# Technologies Used
- Python  
- Requests  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib
 
# Features

- Fetches data from an external API  
- Processes all characters returned by the API  
- Calculates character name lengths  
- Visualizes the results using charts  

# Learning Objectives

This project was developed as a learning exercise to:

- Understand how to work with APIs  
- Practice data analysis using Python  
- Build a foundation for future studies in data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence
